# Notes

The source code of the app contains plugin folder as well because we had to override a plugin in order to accept http connections in the inAppBrowser

# Instructions

## Installation

Clone the App

```bash
git clone https://github.com/socks415/ds1-app
cd ds1-app
npm install
```

## Usage

```bash
cordova platform add android
cordova run android --device
```

That would start the app in a device that has dev mode turned on.
